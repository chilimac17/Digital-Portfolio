# Digital Portfolio
## Web Application Engineering - Spring 2022
In this project we sought to build a version of a custom portfolio website. There are many similar things such as just building your own website and hosting it on GitHub, or even a place like LinkedIn. As a group we worked on a main splash page that would have links to our respective portfolios. We designed our own portfolio pages to show the range of techniques that we have learned in the class.

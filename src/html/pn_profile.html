              <center><img src="../../assets/images/pn_profile.jpg" alt=""></center>
              <p>I always had a love for computer ever since I was little. In middle school I built my first computer and I knew from that day foward that I wanted to work with computer for the rest of my life. In highschool i took every computer programming course I could take and when it came time to pick a college I only had one major in mind. Computer science is my passion and I love coding and problem solving. </p>

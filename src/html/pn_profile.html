          <h3>About Me</h3>
              <center><img src="../../assets/images/pn_profile.jpg" alt=""></center>
              <p>I always had a love for computers ever since I was little. In middle school I built my first computer and I knew from that day forward that I wanted to work with computers for the rest of my life. In highschool i took every computer programming course I could take and when it came time to pick a college I only had one major in mind. Computer science is my passion and I love coding and problem solving.</p>

              <P>From 2014-2018 I attended Jackson Liberty Highschool in jackson New Jersey, where I graduated on honor roll with a 3.5 gpa. I then attended Stockton university in Galloway New Jersey where I studied computer science and maintained a 3.47 gpa. I'm currently on pace to graduate this fall.</P>
